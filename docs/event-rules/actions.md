# Actions
Event Rule actions allow an analyst to apply reactive actions to any Event that matches the criteria of the Rule's Reflex Query. 

## Supported Actions
There are a number of actions that Event Rules can conduct when matched to Events. Multiple actions can be applied simultaneously (e.g. an event can be tagged **and** moved into a case at the same time).

### *Event Actions*
* **Dismiss Event**: select a dismiss reason and enter a dismiss comment to automatically dismiss Events that match this Rule
* **Add Tags**: apply additional tags to Events that match this rule
* **Update Severity**: change the severity of the Event that matches the Rule

### *Case Actions*
* **Create New Case**: creates a new [Case](../cases/cases.md) for every Event that matches the Rule
* **Case Template**: select a [Case Template](../cases/case-templates.md) to apply when the new Case is created
* **Merge into Case**: merges Events that match the Rule into a Case

## Examples
Event Rules are extremely useful for additional automation in your Reflex environment and have countless use cases. Below are a few examples:
* Dismiss all successful remote logins where the username is that of a known admin.
* Dismiss benign or known good values for particular Detections.
* Merge all Events generated by a particular Detection into a Case for client review.
