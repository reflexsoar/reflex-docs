# Role-Based Access
Reflex utilizes role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to the system.

> [Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac) refers to the idea of assigning permissions to users based on their role within an organization. It offers a simple, manageable approach to access management that is less prone to error than assigning permissions to users individually.
