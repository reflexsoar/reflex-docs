# Organizations
**Organizations** create a logical separation in ReflexSOAR that can be useful when you have teams that perform similar security functions but operate independently or when you are Managed Security Service Provider that does Managed Detection & Response for many customers

## Access Scope

- The `Default Organization` has access to all sub-organization and their information as an administrator
- Sub-organization can only see their information
- Each organization must have it's own Agents (they can be paired by fetching the pairing key as a user of the organization or by getting the Persistent Pairing Token from the Organizations settings page)
