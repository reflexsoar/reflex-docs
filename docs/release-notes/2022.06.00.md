## Bugs
- Fix for [reflex-api#207](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/207) - Pattern based intel lists were not matching Events on ingest or when running as part of an Event Rule criteria.  Pattern matching logic was missing entirely after a previous re-architecting of the Event Rule/Event Processing pipeline.

- Fix for [reflex-api#199](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/199) - When the default admin user is left off the Organization creation wizard, organization creation fails
- Fix for [reflex-api#163](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/163) - Agent connections using the `elasticsearch` distribution on inputs were failing to establish connections to due to changes in how Elasticsearch handles connection creation
- Fix for [reflex-api#196](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/196) - The Audit Logs would not displayed correctly in the System > Settings > Audit Logs tab due to an issue with the `ip_approved` route decorator
- Fix for [reflex-api#194](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/194) - When deleting a user their e-mail was preserved and could not be re-used when making a new user.  When a user is deleted now the soft-deleted user will have their email set to `None`
