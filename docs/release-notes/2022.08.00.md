# 2022.08.00 - In Development

## Bugs

- Fix for [reflex-api#229](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/229) - When a Case Template had no tasks the UI would not display any Case Templates on the Case Templates Management page 
- Fix fir [reflex-api#255](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/255) - When no CA cert is supplied the agent would still populate the ca_file property causing Elastic to think HTTPS was expected.
- When dismissing an event the dismissed_by fields were not being populated
- When trying to add events to a case that does not exist, the API would return an Error 500
- When EventWorkers would try to save a task and the save action would time out the Event Worker would crash
- When streaming_bulk had BulkIndexErrors they were unhandled and it would cause EventWorkers to crash
- When RQL syntax was incorrect and Test Rule was sent, the API would return Internal Server Error due to an unhandled exception
- When ExpiredTokens are searched and a timeout occurs there were unhandled exceptions by the API process
- When multiple Threat/Intel Pollers are running (this should never happen), some inflight delete_by_query calls would result in an unhandled exception in the Threat/Intel poller
- EventWorkers were not properly propegating their logs to stdout
- When running Event Workers in dedicated mode and more than 10 organizations/tenants exist, only the first 10 organizations would get an Event Worker pool
- When memcached was down the API and EventWorkers would not gracefully handle the error causing them to have internal server errors or crash, respectively
- Agents Permissions did not default to having the permissions to run detections, poll/update inputs
- When sorting Agents on the Agent List page, paging the results would reset the sort column and order
- When part of the case UUID matched the wrong case history was presented to the API response [Commit](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/pull/311/commits/175043cee2e4d1b42b771ca3936398c2c7df0934)
- When merging cases using event rules they would fail due to `target_case_uuid` being spelled incorrectly [Commit](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/pull/311/commits/108fb646314209eb476468c0e0999223cc31f127)
- When an RQL query has `contains <int>` the rule would fail [Commit](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/pull/311/commits/3944015c6592584e97ad08bac7957f7afb56ef98)
- When an admin in the default organization would create a user with a null organization it would clear out role membership [Commit](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/commit/75c508e0f6155fd0be606763bc143dfb4fc090af)
- Fixed Case Title searching so that it can be a partial search and case insensitive [Commit](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/commit/08b005ebe4a811faaca67fb3d31f8b2601d8ff9b)
- When creating a case from a series of Events, not all Events would be included [reflex-api#317](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/317)
- When using the Merge Into Case context menu, not all Events would merge in to the case [reflex-api#317](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/317)
- When events were merged in to a case they were merged as a list of lists of UUIDs instead of appending [Commit](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/commit/29b4fad1e6285370622b8e59c3d39a76bceefeee)
- EventProcessors were not bulking up events, they were processing one at a time [Commit](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/commit/29b4fad1e6285370622b8e59c3d39a76bceefeee)

## Vulnerability

- Detection List page was not protected by a permission allowing any authenticated user to access this feature and view detections

## Features

- Reflex now supports native detection rules.  See the [Detections](../../detections/) page for more details.
- Reflex now provides an up to date MITRE ATT&CK matrix so users can see how their Detection rules align to MITRE without leaving the platform or having to export data
- Reflex now allows for notifications to specified channels.  See the [Notifications](../../notifications/) page for more details.
- Reflex now allows Security Teams to place a priority order on Event Rules which determines the order in which Event Rules are run, allowing for chaining Event Rules in new ways
- Reflex now allows for dedicated Event Processor Workers for each tenant.  See the [Event Processing](../../events/processing/) page for more details.
- Reflex Event Rules can now automatically create new Cases for each matched event and apply a case template.  See the [Event Rules](../../event-rules/) section for more details.
- Security Teams can now comment directly on individual Events to have a dialogue without merging the Event in to a case
- A new Tuning Advice field is available when dismissing an Event to provide feedback during reporting to detection engineers on how they can fix their detections
- Reflex now supports Agent Policy allowing users to control how all agents are configured from a central location


## Enhancements

- Changes to UI components to be in align with WCAG 2.1
- Event Bulk Ingest now uses a pool of Memcached clients instead of spawning a new client per bulk ingest request.  This is a performance enhancement and a bug fix, the previous method was exhausting available TCP ports.
- Added documentation for Organizations
- Added documentation for Detections
- Agent List now shows Agent Healthy and lists any issues with the agent
- Event Rule List has had columns reworked to reduce screen space, now also shows who created and modified a rule
- Added the ability to control JWT expiration in tenant global settings
- When selecting a close reason for Event dismissal, the Dismiss Comment will automatically fill with the Close Reason description
- New default close reasons and changes to descriptions
- When new default Reflex values are added in the future they will populate across all organizations (e.g. new Close/Dismiss Reasons)
- The API will now wait for a Case to finish creating before redirecting users to the Case page.  Fixes an issue with a Case paged serving a 404.
- Allow `InCIDR` to accept an array of CIDR ranges not only a single string
- Dismiss information now shows up in the Event Drawer of a dismissed Event
- Changes to the Dashboard page, replaced Charts.js for ApexCharts and tabs now separate distinct charting topics
- Enhancement from [reflex-api#257](https://github.com/reflexsoar/reflex-api/issues/257) - Users can now search on the Case List page by the case title, description, comments and observables on the case
- The `InCIDR` RQL operator can now be paired with the `Intel` function to see if an Event fields value is on an intel list of CIDR addresses.  Example `observable.value InCIDR intel("Microsoft IPS")`
- Intel Lists can now change the `IOC`, `Safe` and `Spotted` flags on observables that match a value on the list during Event ingest
- When creating a case from a series of Events use UpdateByQuery instead of the Event Processor
- Leveraging UpdateByQuery instead of the Event Processor for merging Events in to Cases
- When creating a case from events or adding events to a case, the API will only make 2 calls to the backend instead of 1 call per event. This should significantly improve performance when creating cases from large numbers of events.
